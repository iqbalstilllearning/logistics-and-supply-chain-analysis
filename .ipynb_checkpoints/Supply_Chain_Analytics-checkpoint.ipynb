        "The project focuses on leveraging a practical dataset to conduct supply chain analytics, addressing critical challenges in shipment and inventory management. The overarching goal is to identify inefficiencies within the supply chain and develop informative dashboards to assist business stakeholders in pinpointing issues and proposing enhancements. To effectively achieve this objective, the project is divided into three primary goals.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Business Performance (Profit & Cost)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- The initial objective involves analyzing the profit and cost of products. By gaining insights into these metrics, we aim to evaluate the overall performance of the organization.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Inventory Analysis (Supply vs Demand)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- The second objective revolves around assessing the balance between supply and demand for each product within the supply chain.\n",
        "- By examining the supply vs demand ratio, we aim to detect instances of overstocking or understocking for individual products. This insight will facilitate optimized inventory management, ensuring efficient stocking of products and minimizing potential inventory-related inefficiencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Shipment Analysis**\n",
        "\n",
        "- This objective entails analyzing the trend of shipment delays over time, including compiling data on the average days of shipment delay.\n",
        "- Through this analysis, we seek to provide valuable insights into the efficiency of the shipment process, enabling the identification of potential areas for improvement to reduce delays and enhance overall performance."
