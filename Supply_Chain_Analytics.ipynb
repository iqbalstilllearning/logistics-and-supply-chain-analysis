        "The project offers a practical dataset concentrating on supply chain analytics to tackle critical issues in shipment and inventory management. It aims to analyze inefficiencies in the supply chain and generate informative dashboards to aid business stakeholders in identifying problems and suggesting improvements. To efficiently accomplish this objective, the project is segmented into four main goals.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Business Performance (Profit & Cost) :\n",
        "\n",
        "- The first objective analyzing the Profit and Cost of Products. By determining this insights, we can identify the organizationâ€™s overall performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Inventory Analysis (Supply vs Demand):\n",
        "\n",
        "- The second objective is centered around analyzing the ratio between supply and demand for each product in the supply chain.\n",
        "- By determining the Supply vs Demand ratio, we can identify situations of overstock or understock for individual products. This insight will aid in optimizing inventory management, ensuring products are efficiently stocked and reducing any potential inventory-related inefficiencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Shipment Analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "- This objective involves analyzing the trend of shipment delays over time. By compiling information on the average days of shipment delay.\n",
        "- Through this analysis, I intend to provide valuable insights into the efficiency of the shipment process, enabling us to identify potential areas for improvement to reduce delays and enhance overall performance."
